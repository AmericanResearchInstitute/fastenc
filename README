Python representation of Encoding.com's API. The 'fastenc' name is derived
from the company name you get when you whois encoding.com: Fast Encoding Inc.

All of the media encoding workflow is in place, but the user management
features of encoding.com's API are only stubbed out.

Usage examples exist in comments at the moment, and there's some Sphinx
autodoc goodness.

Some inspiration for the way requests are handled came from Brian Jinwright's
'demavision-encoding' projects on github (Thanks Brian!):
